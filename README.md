Introduction
============

This is an example showing how to generate videos of sheet music that scroll
along with an audio track, using the free and open source programs OpenShot
and lilypond.  We use this process to make hymns for the virtual church
services at [The First Presbyterian Church of Ithaca, NY](https://www.firstpresithaca.org/).

Generating the sheet music
==========================

Creating the video requires an image of the sheet music.  This section contains instructions for creating that
image.


The easy way
------------

I use lilypond to generate the image so that I can put each verse on its own
line and control the fonts and formatting.  However, this process has a
learning curve and can be time-consuming; if you'd like to skip it, you can
generate the image any way that is convenient.

For example, you could scan the page from a hymnal or try to find it on the
internet.

OpenShot can't use PDF files, but most PDF viewers have a way to turn a PDF
into an image.  If your software asks you to choose an image size, choosing a
width of 1280 pixels will give you an HD-quality image.
